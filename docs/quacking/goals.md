# Mesh Message Framework Design

## Objective

The primary objective remains consistent: Develop a protocol-agnostic mesh messaging framework that initializes with zero configuration.

## Implementation Details

- **Initialization**: Any client device or user agent should be capable of initiating and establishing a connection without extensive setup. The process should be as simple as executing a boot sequence followed by a connection handshake.

- **Minimal Pre-Configuration**: The emphasis is on reducing the initial setup overhead. The system should be designed such that message emission can commence immediately post-connection, relying on a minimal set of pre-configured parameters.

- **Security & Identification**: The framework should incorporate a robust registration and API protocol. This ensures that any connecting user or device is authenticated and subsequently identified in a secure manner.

## Key Features

1. **Zero-Config Initialization**: Devices should be able to integrate into the mesh without any preliminary configuration.

2. **User Autonomy & Decentralization**: The system should empower users with control while promoting a decentralized architecture.

3. **Seamless Mesh Integration**: Devices should be able to instantly connect and communicate with other routers within the mesh network.

4. **Hierarchical Messaging**: The messaging protocol should support layered communication, allowing for both peer-to-peer exchanges and top-level controls.

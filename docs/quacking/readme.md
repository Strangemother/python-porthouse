# Quack Quack.

A friend of mine told be about the 'talk to a duck' method. Where you vocalise technical issues to an inanimate yellow duck. We gain clarity when working through the problem with said duck.

I don't have a duck; And I felt silly talking to a blank patch on my desk - so this is my "quacking". A lot of very scratchy notes detailing the aspects we want before a better writeup.

In many occasions this may be wrong, incomplete, or just plain nonsense.

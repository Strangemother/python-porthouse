## Long Distance Zero Config Edge to Edge Meshing

The primary long distance goal is to generate a meshing library where all clients naturally connect across a local network to mesh communicate across peers. A message through the network should reach a destination through peer hops.

A Server ingress may be hosted on any device, communicating in the preferred local protocol. Sibling nodes should provide the same communication method such as network, wifi, bluetooth etc...

configuration should be done by the client, assigning an API key and connection library to each node unit (a pc). Upon activation the connection is immediate, bridging and communicating to other mesh nodes.


## - Peer to Peer Signal server

A JS Peer to peer server needs a 'signal' server to function. This can be the head.

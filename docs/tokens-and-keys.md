# Token-Based Socket Authentication and Authorization

## Overview

In the context of our WebSocket communication framework, a `Key Entry` mechanism is introduced to streamline the connection and authentication process. This mechanism leverages tokens, which are generated within the system and provided to clients for their external socket connections.

## Token Generation and Assignment

### Token Creation

Tokens are cryptographic strings generated by the system, ensuring secure and unique identification for each client or device.

### Permissions and Roles

Each token can encapsulate specific permissions and roles. These permissions dictate the actions a socket can perform and the rooms it can access. By assigning granular permissions to tokens, the system can automate device actions and room access.

## Connection Flows

### Standard Connection Flow

1. **Connect**: The client establishes a connection to the primary WebSocket URL.

2. **Authentication**: The client provides its unique ID for authentication. This can be done manually (e.g., through a text input interface) or programmatically.

3. **Subscription**: Once authenticated, the client can issue commands to subscribe to specific rooms or channels.

4. **Message Exchange**: The client can now send and receive messages within the subscribed rooms.

### Token-Based Connection Flow

1. **Tokenized Connect**: The client establishes a connection and simultaneously provides its unique token as an identifier.

2. **Automatic Authorization**: The system recognizes the token, automatically granting the socket the permissions encapsulated within the token. This might include auto-subscribing the socket to specific rooms.

3. **Message Exchange**: With permissions granted, the client can immediately start exchanging messages without further manual interventions.

## Benefits of Token-Based Authentication

- **Simplified Flow**: Reduces the steps required for a client to start communicating, enhancing user experience and reducing potential points of failure.

- **Granular Control**: Tokens can be tailored to grant specific permissions, offering fine-grained control over what each client can do.

- **Security**: Token-based authentication ensures that only authorized clients can connect and interact with the system.
